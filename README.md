# Noon-Video-Downloader
A GUI for the Youtube-DL library, using the .NET Framework.

My first real program that uses Youtube-DL to make an easy to use GUI.

Currently the functions are basic, nothing more than mp4 and mp3 download. 

However, as time goes on, I will add more features.

All bugs and issues should be refered to the common-bugs.txt either here in this repository or in the application.
