## [VDDL] Bugs and Errors
- If you get the error 'Log Directory does not exist', you must create a log first. (This should be fixed as of v1.0.0)

## Youtube-DL Bugs and Errors
- If the downloader is unable to extract the title your cookie file is invalid. Simply create a new one and reload it.
- If the error is related to authentication, make sure you have permission to view the link you are trying to download.
- (Playlist (not to confused with Batch Download) Download) If you get an error saying 'Cannot save audio and video on same file', this means you have a space in you output folder. I'm not sure why but it seems the output directory cannot have any spaces.


## Cookies
- Cookies are needed for privated youtube videos, and anything that is block my a login.
- In order to create a proper cookie file, download any cookie plugin/addon for your browser. Then save the cookie file as a ".txt", the name doesn't matter.
- Then depending on what site you are downloading from, make sure you are logged in to the correct account.
